# Title - C. Equipment Management System

## Status - Proposed

## Context - 
### Requirement (Functional): 
        - Register equipment 
        - Un-Register equipment
### Solution : Equipment Management System
   1.1 System API - Synchrounous call from experience api
        Equipment Management System API - To interface Equipment Management System with two endpoints to register and unregister equipments 
   1.4 Expereince API - Mobile/Web channel interface to register / unregister equipments
        Equipment Management Experience API - Call Equipment Management System API Synchrounously
### Dependency & Assumption
        Equipment Management System - As-is system to manage POS and Smart fridges

## Decision - API-Led Architecture with Message Queue and Micro services
1.  System API, Process API, Experiece API are cloud based microservices scalability, elasticity would be achieved
2.  Database behind Equipment Management System  ensure reliability.
3.  Micro services (System API, Experiece API)  on cloud provides elasticity in case of high demand of users in pick time and or peak season(holidays)
4.  Security - Following Policy on microservices to be applied for security and compliance
        5.1 - Rate limit - No of requests per second and burst time
        5.2 - Authrization Policy - Token based authorization would track and control the requests and provide secured access.

## Consequences
1. A Three Layer Architecture mentioned above would add network delay if deployment model is wrongly choosed.
